I have used shader graph before so this was pretty simple. 
The screenshots are in the screenshots folder with the red, green, blue passed bunnies as well as a blended screen space checkerboard-bunny texture.

The bunny model was sourced from here: https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/bunny-4cc18d8e0552459b8897948b81cb20ad
